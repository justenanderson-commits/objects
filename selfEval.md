# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I didn't struggle too much in this section. Again, the javaScript pre-learning I did is really coming in handy right now!

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It's going fine. I hand-write a lot of notes for little things to commit to memory and take screenshots (then put them in a Google Doc) for more complicated pieces.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I definitely lean into trying to solve the problem on my own at first. Often there's just a silly little mistake that I need to fix, like a typo or forgotten capitalization (like object vs Object when trying to call a method). If I get stuck with code issuse, I go to the MDN docs first. If it's something else (i.e. a git issue), I head to Google if I can't figure it out on my own.
